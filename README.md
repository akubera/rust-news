# Rust News

A rust application which compiles rust-community news


## About

This is a little project to see if git-based collaboration is practical.
The goal is to provide a simple way to suggest items to be added to a news stream;
specifically regarding the rust programming language.

This repository has two parts:
+ A 'news' branch containing standard yaml files representing news posts
+ A 'master' and 'dev' branch which houses the rust application code that renders the yaml files

To submit news, fork this repository and pull only the news branch. Add/edit yaml files to your content
and submit a pull request.
